Our code runs on Unix (specifically, the hive instructional machines).

Zack submitted the source code.

Notes:
- We use a max recursion depth of 5 for adaptive subdivision.
- We referenced the pseudocode for uniform subdivision from the Lecture 12 Slides, page 29.
- We referenced the splitting cases for adaptive subdivision from the Lecture 12 Slides, page 29.
- We hand wrote the shape.bez file.
- We used blender (open source 3D modeling software) to create the monkey.obj and the sphere obj files.
- We got the heart.obj and heart.bez files from the blender repository and an online resource (links on website).
- Some code is borrowed from previous assignments. Specifcally, much of the OpenGL is from Assignment 0 and 1.
  The file parser is mostly copied from Assignment 2.

Extra Features:

===== OBJ Input
When .obj files are passed as the only argument to the program, the model is created. Our program parses the following OBJ commands: v, vn, f
It only assembles triangles.

===== Curvature
For exact curvature when rendering .bez files
	- pressing 'g' turns on gaussian curvature
	- pressing 'm' turns on mean curvature
	- pressing '1' toggles max curvature
	- pressing '2' toggles min curvature

For approximate curvature when rendering .obj files
	- pressing 'g' turns on the unsigned gaussian curvature. This looks good on monkey.obj, heart.obj, sphere_small.obj, 
	  sphere_large.obj, and torus.obj.

===== Color
- pressing 'c' rotates the diffuse and specular costants between preset colors

===== Video

===== Hidden Line Mode
- pressing 'h' toggles hidden line mode when in wireframe mode.
